## Supervised Learning and Regression

---

In this course we will be focused on [Supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) machine learning models which means we know the answer (the 'label') for the past that we can train our model to learn from. 

The first model type you will use in this course is Regression. Regression can be used for all types of ML use cases like predicting sales (Linear Regression) to classifying buy or no-buy (Logistic Regression AKA classification). You'll practice building your first ML model to predict stock price values using a quick regression model with BigQuery ML. 

**What follows this is a quick Python skills assessment to see if you pass the required fundamentals for the labs -- feel free to use Google Search and any other guides as you work through the questions.**
