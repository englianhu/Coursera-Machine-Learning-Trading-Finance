We have been talking about correlation and cointegration. Please select the statements below that are correct


- Cointegration is the same as correlation except that cointegration is the correlation of the means of two price series.

これを選択しないでください
Cointegration indicates that the difference between the means of two price series is stationary (reverts to a long-term mean). A cointegrated series series can also be correlated but this is not required. Also, the mean of a price series is a single number, so the means of two price series cannot be correlated. All we can measure is their difference.  


- Cointegration and correlation both imply that the two price series are stationary.

これを選択しないでください
Only cointegration implies stationarity of the difference between the means of each price series. Two series may be correlated but not stationary.


✔️Cointegration indicates that the difference between the means of two price series is stationary. Correlation implies that the returns from two prices series are related, either positively or negatively.

正解
Cointegration indicates that the difference between the means of two price series is stationary (reverts to a long-term mean). A cointegrated series series can also be correlated but this is not required. Correlation indicates that a price series has some relationship with another price series. This relationship can be very strong in the case of perfect positive (+1) or negative (-1) correlation or non-existent in the case of zero correlation.
