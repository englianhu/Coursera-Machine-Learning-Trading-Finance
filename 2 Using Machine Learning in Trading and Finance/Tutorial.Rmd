##### Wk 1.1.2.1 : 動画中のテスト : Basic Trading Strategy Entries and Exits Endogenous Exogenous

質問 1 : If you are long an asset (or instrument), what are some examples of pre-planned risk management?

<span style='color:green'>✔️ A sell order above the current market price</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
This would automatically take a profit on your holding if the market trades higher and would also reduce (or eliminate) your long exposure which would reduce your risk. This is a trade "exit" which we will talk about later.</span>

❌ A buy order above the current market price

><span style='color:#e99986'>**これを選択しないでください**
This would add to your long position and increase your risk exposure. This is not risk management but could be part of a momentum strategy which we will talk about in later session.</span>

<span style='color:green'>✔️ A sell order below the current market price</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
This is a stop-loss order that would limit your losses on your long position in the market trades lower. We will talk about different types of stop losses later.</span>

❌ A buy order below the current market price

><span style='color:#e99986'>**これを選択しないでください**
This would increase your risk exposure when you are already taking a loss on your current long position. this is an example of a trade "entry" which we will talk about later.</span>

質問 2 : Which of the following are examples of a combination of endogenous and exogenous trading rules

❌ Sell Microsoft if the closing price is below the daily average and the volume traded is higher than the previous day's volume

><span style='color:#e99986'>**これを選択しないでください**
This is a combination of two endogenous rules as both are based on Microsoft's price and volume traded.</span>

<span style='color:green'>✔️ Sell Microsoft if the closing price is below the daily average and the closing price of SPY (S&P 500 ETF) is also below its daily average.</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
This is a combination of and endogenous rule based on Microsoft's closing price and an exogenous rule based on SPY's closing price.</span>

<span style='color:green'>✔️ Sell Microsoft if trading volume is lower than the previous day and the unemployment rate increased during the previous month.</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
This is a combination of and endogenous rule based on Microsoft's trading volume and an exogenous rule based on the level of a macroeconomic variable.</span>

❌ Buy Apple if reported quarterly profits are up and Microsoft's reported quarterly sales are down.

><span style='color:#e99986'>**これを選択しないでください**
This is a combination of two exogenous rules, one based on Apple's fundamental data and one based on Microsoft's fundamental data.</span>

##### Wk 1.1.2.2 : 動画中のテスト : Basic Trading Strategy Building a Trading Model

質問 1 : You have sold short Amazon at 1,800 and have a 50 basis point profit objective, Which order should you place for your profit exit?

- Buy Amazon at 1,890
- Sell Amazon at 1,890
- Buy Amazon at 1,710
- <span style='color:green'>✔️ Sell Amazon at 1,710</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
This would be a profit exit as you have sold Amazon short at 1,800 and bought it back at 1,710 for a profit of 90 or 0.5%</span>

##### Wk 1.1.2.3 : 動画中のテスト : Advanced Concepts in Trading Strategies

質問 1 : If you sell MSFT at 150  and have a profit objective of 500 basis points and a loss tolerance of 200 basis points what exit orders should you place?

- Buy MSFT at 147 and buy MSFT at 157.5
- Sell MSFT at 147 and sell MSFT at 157.5
- Buy MSFT at 142.5 and buy MSFT at 153
- <span style='color:green'>✔️ Buy MSFT at 147 and buy MSFT at 153</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
This would be a profit objective 500 basis points (as selling MSFT at 150 and buying it back at 142.5 would give you a profit of 7.5 or 5%) and a loss tolerance of 200 basis points (as selling MSFT at 150 and buying it back at 153 would give you a loss of 3 or 2%.</span>

質問 2 : You are trading Alphabet (GOOG) and have entered with a buy of 1000 shares at $1100. You have a profit target of 400 basis points and a dynamic stop-loss initially set at 200 basis points below your entry point. During the next week the trading range for GOOG is 1080 to 1130.  At the end of the week the price of GOOG is 1110 and your trade is still open. What exit orders do you currently have in the market?

- Stop-loss order to sell GOOG at 1078 and a limit order to sell GOOG at 1144.
- Stop-loss order to sell GOOG at 1107.40 and a limit order to sell GOOG at 1175.2.
- Stop-loss order to sell GOOG at 1107.40 and a limit order to sell GOOG at 1144.
- <span style='color:green'>✔️ Stop-loss order to sell GOOG at 1100 and a limit order to sell GOOG at 1144</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
Yes. You correctly adjusted your dynamic stop-loss order so that it is 200 basis points below the maximum price of GOOG during the week, and you kept your profit exit order at its original level of 4% above your entry point of 1100.</span>

質問 3 : You are trading Microsoft (MSFT) and have shorted 1,000 shares at $160. You have a profit target of 500 basis points and a variable dynamic stop-loss initially set at 300 basis points above your entry point.

Your risk management strategy is to reduce the size of your stop-loss margin by 50% of your unrealized profit ( on your MSFT short position and to have the stop-loss level adjust to the current MSFT price if your trade has an unrealized profit. If your trade has an unrealized loss the stop-loss level stays at the original level

During the next 5 days the trading range for MSFT is 154 to 164. At the end of the week the price of MSFT is 154 and your trade is still open. What exit orders do you currently have in the market?

- Stop-loss order to buy MSFT at 161.62 and a limit order to buy back MSFT at 152.
- Stop-loss order to buy MSFT at 158.62 and a limit order to buy back MSFT at 152.
- Stop-loss order to buy MSFT at 164.80 and a limit order to buy back MSFT at 152.
- <span style='color:green'>✔️ Stop-loss order to buy MSFT at 155.62 and a limit order to buy back MSFT at 152.</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
Yes, these would the exit orders based on a variable dynamic stop loss where the stop-loss level trails the lowest price achieved by MSFT during the period and the stop-loss margin is reduced by 50% of the unrealized profit. The stop-loss level for a dynamic stop loss would be 154 * 1.03 = 158.62. As you are using a variable dynamic stop loss, and your short position has an unrealized profit of 160 - 154 = \$6, you need to reduce the stop-loss margin by 50% of this amount or \$3. Your stop loss should be set at 158.62 - 3 = 155.62.</span>

##### Wk 1.1.2.4 : テスト : Understand Quantitative Strategies

**Understand Quantitative Strategies (合計点数 4)**

質問 1 : If you believe that the price and volume history of an asset are all that is needed to design a trading strategy then you would would use an endogenous trading rule. What is the theoretical justification for using this type of strategy? (1点)

- Markets are efficient and fully incorporate all available information (both public and private).
- Asset prices follow a random walk with equal probabilities of increasing and decreasing
- <span style='color:green'>✔️ Asset and market prices tend to have momentum so that stocks whose prices are in an up trends tend to increase in value and those in a downtrend tend to decrease in value.</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
Yes, if you believe that asset prices have momentum then price and volume data is all you need to make predictions of future prices.</span>

- <span style='color:green'>✔️ Fundamental data such as historic earning and sales growth are already fully reflected in the current market price and so have no predictive power.</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
Yes, if you instead believed that fundamental data have predictive value, then you should incorporate them into an exogenous trading rule.</span>

質問 2 : The basic trading model parameters are entry signal, profit exit, stop-loss and time-out. How can you use these parameters and machine learning to optimize your trading strategy? (1点)

- Vary the the type of entry signal and profit exit levels in backtesting with the objective of maximizing profit.
- <span style='color:green'>✔️ Vary the the type of entry signal, profit exit levels,  stop loss levels and trade completion time limits in backtesting with the objective of maximizing risk adjusted return (Sharpe ratio) within your tolerance for PnL volatility and maximum drawdown.</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
Yes, Sharpe ratio maximization leads to an optimal trading strategy as long as it is constrained by time limits, PnL volatility limits and maximum drawdown tolerance. This will give you a strategy with stop-loss levels that can be tolerated when you implement it in  live trading.</span>

- Vary the the type of entry signal and profit exit levels in backtesting with the objective of maximizing risk adjusted return (Sharpe ratio).

質問 3 : The main benefit of a dynamic stop loss over a static stop loss is that: (1点)

- <span style='color:green'>✔️ Dynamic stop losses reduce the expected risk of your strategy.</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>正解**
Yes. Dynamic stop losses, which maintain a fixed margin between the stop-loss level and the most favorable market price achieved, can reduce the maximum loss in a strategy (at worst the maximum loss is unaffected). This reduces the expected risk in the strategy but also make it more likely that you will be stopped out rather than profited out. This can have a negative impact on your expected return from a strategy.</span>

- Dynamic stop losses increase your expected returns from a trading strategy.
- Dynamic stop losses guarantee that your strategy will not make a loss even if it is stopped out.

質問 4 : Endogenous trading rules are often created by: (1点)

- <span style='color:green'>✔️ Technical analysts</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
Yes, Technical analysts or chartists believe that all of the information necessary to create a trading rule or strategy is contained in the price and volume history of an asset.</span>

- Statistical arbitrage traders
- Strategists
- Quantitative trading groups

### Wk 3.1 : Build a Momentum-based Trading System

#### Wk 3.1.1 : Identify momentum-based factors

##### Wk 3.1.1.1 : 動画中のテスト : Introduction to Momentum Trading

質問 1 : You can choose two moving average window lengths so that the crossovers will most closely match the optimal buy and sell points in your historical data. What is the weakness of this strategy?

- You may end up with non-standard window lengths that are not widely used.
- You end up using arbitrary window lengths to fit your data.
- <span style='color:green'>✔️ It is better to use a single moving average and choose the window length to create the crossover points that most closely match the optimal buy and sell points.</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
This is a big weakness. Anyone can create a strategy that maximizes profit on a historical data set. The problem is that the strategy is only effective for the historical data and fails to perform well with unseen data. This is an example of overfitting your strategy.</span>

質問 2 : Which of the following are advantages of using moving average ribbons instead of selecting two moving average window lengths to identify buy and sell signals?

<span style='color:green'>✔️ You avoid overfitting your data with specific moving average window lengths.</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
Yes, by using a moving average ribbon, your strategy will be based on a whole range of window lengths which will help you avoid overfitting your strategy to two or three specific window lengths.</span>

❌ Using a moving average ribbon will give you many more buy and sell signals than using two moving average windows

><span style='color:#e99986'>**これを選択しないでください**
Using an MA ribbon instead of selecting two MA window lengths should not have a significant effect on the number of buy and sell signal, if anything it might lead to fewer and better signals. Please review the video on Momentum Trading Strategies.</span>

<span style='color:green'>✔️ By looking at the entire "shape" of the ribbon rather than two specific window lengths, you can get a better quality trading signal.</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
Yes, you can rank all of the moving averages and create a normalized score that should give you an improved trade signal.</span>


##### Wk 3.1.1.3 : 学習用教材 : Hurst Exponent and Trading Signals Derived from Market Time Series

**Hurst Exponent and Trading Signals Derived from Market Time Series**

If you would like to explore the Hurst coefficient as a trading signal, please have a look at “[Hurst Exponent and Trading Signals Derived from Market Time Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/englianhu/Coursera-Machine-Learning-for-Trading/090acd0b5db6961655c0172cd766e43419a0341f/2%20Using%20Machine%20Learning%20in%20Trading%20and%20Finance/reference/Hurst%20Exponent%20and%20Trading%20Signals%20Derived%20from%20Market%20Time%20Series.pdf)([origin](https://www.scitepress.org/papers/2018/66670/66670.pdf))” by *Petr Kroha and Miroslav Skoula (2018)*. They give a good survey of the theory behind Hurst and also create a “Moving Hurst” trading signal that they test against an MACD signal on NASDAQ and DAX data. They conclude that Moving Hurst is a better trade signal than MACD, but that it fails to make a profit when trading costs are factored in.

#### Wk 3.1.2 : Build a trading model that uses momentum factors

##### Wk 3.1.2.9 : ディスカッションのプロンプト : Compare interpretability versus explanatory power of the momentum factor

**Compare interpretability versus explanatory power of the momentum factor**

返答が投稿されました。以下より他の受講生と交流して議論しましょう！

> Interpretability is about the extent to which a cause and effect can be observed within a system. Or, to put it another way, it is the extent to which you are able to predict what is going to happen, given a change in input or algorithmic parameters. It’s being able to look at an algorithm and go yep, I can see what’s happening here.
> 
Explainability, meanwhile, is the extent to which the internal mechanics of a machine or deep learning system can be explained in human terms. It’s easy to miss the subtle difference with interpretability, but consider it like this: interpretability is about being able to discern the mechanics without necessarily knowing why. Explainability is being able to quite literally explain what is happening.

Momentum trading strategies, based on concepts from physics, attempt to take advantage of stocks' tendencies to continue going either up or down, independent of daily fluctuations. Contrarily, mean-reversion strategies are based on trends reversing direction.

In this lab, you'll apply some of the concepts you have learned behind momentum trading and mean reversion by leveraging the [Auquan Toolbox](https://github.com/Auquan/auquan-toolbox-python), a Python library that provides tools for developing trading algorithms. When building trading strategies you'll rarely start from scratch. In this lab you'll be given code of a trading strategy implementation that loses money. Your job will be to modify the code so that the strategy makes money.

### Wk 4.1 : Build a Pair Trading Strategy Prediction Model

#### Wk 4.1.1 : Picking Pairs

##### Wk 4.1.1.1 : 動画中のテスト : Introduction to Pair Trading

質問 1 : It is important to keep in mind that the beta of a stock is just an estimate based on the regression of the stocks performance each day versus the daily performance of the overall market. Beta can change depending on the historical period you are using for the regression. This is why, for trading, you need to use a fairly recent historical period that will be a good predictor of the stocks performance in the future.

- What is the advantage of using a beta-hedged long-short pair versus a single stock?
- Beta hedging attempts to balance the market risk of the long side of the pair with the market risk of the short side.
- Beta hedging hedges out all risks from your pair strategy.
- <span style='color:green'>✔️ Beta hedging hedges out the unsystematic risk of your pair strategy.</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
This is true. When you beta hedge you are not trying to hedge out the idiosyncratic or unsystematic risk of the pair. You are only trying to eliminate the systematic or market risk of the pair by being long the same amount of market risk that you are short in the pair. This means that your strategy is not a bet on the direction of the market, just a bet on the relative performance of the stocks in your pair.</span>

質問 2 : MSFT is currently trading at 150 with a beta of 0.8 and AAPL is at 250 with a beta of 1.2. Create a beta hedged strategy where you are long 1000 shares of AAPL. How many shares of MSFT should you be short?

- Short 1000 shares of MSFT
- Short 1500 shares of MSFT
- Short 1667 shares of MSFT
- <span style='color:green'>✔️ Short 2500 shares of MSFT</span>

><span style='color:#72e67e'>**正解**
Correct. You need to short 1000*[1.2/0.8]*[250/150] = 2500 shares of MSFT to adjust for AAPL's higher price and beta.</span>
